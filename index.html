    <h1>How it feels to be a kagurabachi fan</h1>
    <h2>The Strongest Agenda of Today</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Leo, and I go to staten island technical high school.<br />
      I have many hobbies: playing games, sports, and reading novels.<br />
      One novel I want to introduce everyone to is kagurabachi.<br />
      Those who have read kagurabachi will understand the enjoyment that the
      series provides through its meaningful characters and plot.<br />
      Furthermore, Kagurabachi overall has very appealing art and a great use of
      fight choreography in order to make great action scenes
